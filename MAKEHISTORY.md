### Games & things I've made
- recreating various arcade games in Microsoft XNA, Monogame, Gamemaker, Adobe Flash Love2D, Cocos2D, Godot, Unity
- Ambush of the Outpost of Rodne (2012): First "game" made, for a high-school project. Used ALICE, a drag&drop "game" (animation) maker. A short 3D excursion with story-telling elements.
- The Legend of Dragoon Shooter (2012): Second game made, for a high-school project. Used Gamemaker, modifying and expanding upon a 2D side-scrolling platform shooter project I found online, replacing characters and environments with things from my favorite Playstation One video game The Legend of Dragoon, and modifying the physics engine.
- (trying to remember the name) (2013): A submission to FBLA's Business & Game Development competition, winning local & state (VA) contests and flying out to Los Angelas for nationals (did not win). First game created in a (3-person) team, using Gamemaker. Player assisted in developing a struggling business by assisting each head of department with answering business trivia questions and providing recommendations (the competition outlined requirements to make it a trivia-based game while under the umbrella of "business simulation").
- WoW addons: various weakauras (https://wago.io/p/Lavitz), LavitzFrostboltz (https://github.com/Lavitzio/LavitzFrostboltzWA), XpCounter (port & feature-add https://github.com/Lavitzio/XpCounter), MapCanvas (failed): a canvas of every city, battleground, world pop zone, raid encounter to develop strategies; ability to share and store with guild & friends, website to download packs that users/guilds create; features: draw arrows, circles, icons of every class/role, able to have "frames" of the same battle, each a subtitle under the title of the "pack".
- Wonder prototype (2016): short turn-based 1v1 strategy game, taking actions to either defend, scout or attack (with various attack styles and systems). Like Dwarf Tower but simpler and before I knew about it. Intentionally low-res graphics, in-browser and on mobile, quick games w/ aesthetic progression systems.
- Blueman's Fateful Return Home (2020): A Mario-like platformer for a Unity Connect challenge "Boss Fight". Picked up Unity again for a couple weeks to enter a small community competition. https://play.unity.com/mg/2d/blueman-s-fateful-return-home

I've also made other random things like multiple YouTube channels with hundreds of videos, and a plethora of random digital art including forum signatures, MLG GameBattles team logos, personal logos, graphics for political campaigns & education websites, sprite art for games, etc. And I've done random things like competed in video game competitions (Halo 3, Halo Wars, Gears of War 2, Starcraft 2, Counter Strike: Source), streamed gaming before Twitch was a thing (2010-2012), DJ'd house parties and events ("CA$HTAG" 2014-2016), made a few electronic mixes with FL Studio & Ableton, experimented making chip-tune with MilkyTracker, and have a rap album in production to be released 2022 titled "Moraine". I have several screenplay and book ideas I'd love to write, too.

I just like thinking about & doing random things.
